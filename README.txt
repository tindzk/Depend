Jivai-Utils
-----------

Jivai-Utils is a set of tools easing the development with Jivai.

The  main   strength  is  its   build  system  which   resolves  all
dependencies automatically.  It  is different  from GNU  Autoconf by
eliminating the  need for  bootstrapping.  In contrast  to Autoconf,
Jivai-Utils   does   not   rely   on   any   external  applications.
Therefore, it runs much faster.

Jivai-Utils enables  you to build  whole applications with  only one
command!  They do not even need to use the Jivai library. As long as
the dependencies are specified properly, it will work fine.

Features:
 * Prototype generator
 * Dependency resolver
 * Build system
